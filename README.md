# Car-damage-Recognition
•	Developed a car damage classifier model using deep learning techniques to automatically detect and classify different types of damages in vehicle images. <br />
•	Preprocessed a large dataset of labeled car images, including normal and damaged vehicle images, to train the classifier model. Employed transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model to achieve higher accuracy and reduce training time. <br />
•	Utilized TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to implement and train the classifier model. <br />
•	Integrated OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction. <br />
•	Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly application, allowing users to upload car images and receive predictions on the presence and severity of damages. <br />
